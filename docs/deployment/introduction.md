# Deployment Examples

This section assumes you have deployed the full-stack server profile in [Get Started](../get-started/introduction.md).

In this section, you will find examples for using **Docker Compose** and **Helm/Kubernetes** to deploy Ping products in typical combinations.  In addition, examples of additional components, such as those for monitoring or using the Hashicorp vault for securing passwords or tokens are provided.
