# Docker Compose

Docker Compose provides light orchestration of containers, supporting the deployment of stack of containers quickly on a single host using configurations specified in YAML files.

To deploy typical use cases, try the examples for Docker Compose in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose` directory.

For more information about the structure of Docker Compose YAML files provided by Ping, see [this page](../reference/yamlFiles.md)
