# Deploy with Docker-Compose

We use Docker Compose for light orchestration of containers, deploying a stack of containers quickly, on a single host, based on configurations specified in YAML files.

To deploy typical use cases, try the examples for Docker Compose in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose`.

For more information about the structure of Docker Compose YAML files provided by Ping, see [this page](../reference/yamlFiles.md)
