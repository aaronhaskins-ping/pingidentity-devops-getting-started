# Next Steps

After you've deployed a set of our DevOps images using the full-stack server profile in [Get Started](../get-started/introduction.md), you can move on to deployments using server profiles that might more closely reflect use cases you want to test out. 

Paths to pursue include:

* Continue working with the full-stack server profile in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/03-full-stack` directory.
* Try our other server profiles in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started` directory to quickly deploy typical use cases.
* Clone the [`pingidentity-server-profiles`](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles) repository to your local `${HOME}/projects/devops` directory and learn about the setup of specific product configurations.

For further examples and more details on deploying using `docker compose` or `Kubernetes` see the [Deployment Section](../deployment/introduction.md) section of this site.
